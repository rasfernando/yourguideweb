  <h1>YourGuide Account & Data Deletion</h1>
  <p><em>Effective Date: 13 January 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    At YourGuide, we believe it is important for users to have full control over 
    their personal data. This page outlines how you can request the deletion of 
    your account and any associated data. Please note that our app does not 
    currently support in-app deletion; all deletion requests must be made via email.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How to Request Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    To request the deletion of your account and associated data, please send an 
    email to <a href="mailto:admin@yourguide.city">admin@yourguide.city</a> 
    with the subject line: <strong>“Account Deletion Request”</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your email, please include:
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name (as used in the YourGuide app)</li>
      <li>The email address associated with your YourGuide account</li>
      <li>A brief statement confirming that you wish to delete your account</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> We may require additional information to verify ownership 
    of the account before proceeding with the deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data That Will Be Deleted</h2>
  <p>
    Once we have verified your request, we will delete:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Personal information such as your name, email address, and any profile details 
      you provided.
    </li>
    <li>
      Usage data associated with your account, which may include your location 
      history (if permission was granted) and any preferences you have saved.
    </li>
    <li>
      Purchase history tied to your account (although anonymized transaction 
      records may be retained by our payment processor for legal/audit purposes).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Certain types of information may need to be retained for a limited period 
    to fulfill legal or administrative obligations, such as record-keeping 
    and fraud prevention. In such cases, this data is securely stored and 
    inaccessible for any other use. We will permanently delete your account 
    information once all legal retention requirements have been met.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Deletion Timeline</h2>
  <p>
    We strive to process all verified account deletion requests within 
    <strong>30 days</strong> of confirmation. You will receive a confirmation 
    email once your account has been deleted from our systems.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Irreversible Action</h2>
  <p>
    Please note that account and data deletion is permanent and cannot be 
    reversed. If you wish to use YourGuide again, you will need to create 
    a new account.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding our account deletion 
    process or our data practices, please email us at 
    <a href="mailto:admin@yourguide.city">admin@yourguide.city</a>.

    Thank you for using YourGuide. We value your privacy and are committed 
    to making our data deletion process as clear and straightforward as possible.
